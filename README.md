  # github-final-project
## Introduction
This project is all about providing opportunities to low income individuals and to calculate simple interest.

## Description
   I am a developer, here i will host the sample code of calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. I will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this project and create supporting documents for the open source project including code of conduct, and contributing guidelines. Additionally, the repository will be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0. 
 ### Simple interest Explanation
      Simple Interest is the convenient method used in banking and economic sectors to calculate the interest charges on loans.It gets estimated day to day with the help of some mathematical terms.

   #### Formula
      Simple Interest = (P × R × T)/100   
           where ,
             P = Principal Amount
             R = Rate per Annum 
             T = Time (years)  
   #### Complexity of this program
                      O(1)
                      
   ### Example
    Explanation - We need to find simple interest on 
    Rs. 10, 000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
    units of time.

    Input :  P = 10000
             R = 5
            T = 5
    Output : 2500
  ### Instructions
